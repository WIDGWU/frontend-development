## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Use of YARN rather than npm

At the current moment of building WID frontend, yarn has a better speed and performance than npm because of which I am using yarn.
There is a possibility of getting deprecated warning with npm, so please stick with yarn if you are continuing to build this in future.
